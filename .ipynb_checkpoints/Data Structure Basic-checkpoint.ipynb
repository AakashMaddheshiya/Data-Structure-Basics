    "# The Importance of Immutable Dictionary Keys\n",
    "# In Python, dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. The keys must be immutable objects, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. This constraint is crucial for the efficient operation of dictionaries and the integrity of their data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Immutable Keys?\n",
    "# Hashing: Dictionaries use hashing to store and retrieve values efficiently. Hash functions are designed to produce consistent hash values for immutable objects. If keys were mutable, their hash values could change, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential data corruption.   \n",
    "# Indexing: Dictionaries use hash values to index their elements. Immutable keys ensure that the index remains constant, allowing for fast and reliable lookups.   \n",
    "# Comparison: Dictionaries use key equality to determine if two elements are the same. Immutable keys guarantee that the comparison operation will always yield consistent results.\n",
    "# Data Integrity: Immutable keys prevent accidental modifications that could corrupt the dictionary's structure or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of Immutable Keys\n",
    "# Numbers: Integers, floats, and complex numbers are immutable.   \n",
    "# Strings: Strings are immutable sequences of characters.   \n",
    "# Tuples: Tuples are immutable collections of elements.   \n",
    "# Frozen sets: Frozen sets are immutable sets.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implications of Mutable Keys\n",
    "# If you attempt to use a mutable object as a dictionary key, Python will raise a TypeError. This is a safety mechanism to prevent potential data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "my_dict = {\n",
